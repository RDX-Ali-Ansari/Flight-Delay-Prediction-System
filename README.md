# Flight Delay Analysis with Linear Regression ✈️

This project uses historical flight data to analyze flight delays, with a focus on predicting arrival delays based on departure delays using linear regression. The project uses Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface for visualizations and model analysis.

## Features 🌟

- **Dataset Overview**: Displays key statistics and details about the flight delay dataset.
- **Delay Distribution**: Shows the distribution of both arrival and departure delays.
- **Relationship between Delays**: Visualizes the correlation between departure and arrival delays.
- **Flight Cancellation Probability**: Calculates and displays the probability of a flight being cancelled.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Uses a simple linear regression model to predict arrival delays based on departure delays, and displays the model’s performance metrics (MSE and R²).
